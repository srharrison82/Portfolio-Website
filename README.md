# Portfolio-Website
The portfolio website project to host other projects. 

It will be worked on by cloning the remote repository from GitHub. This it to become comfortable with this process as it is more realistic to and office based work environment. 

This website will provide a clear and simple presentation to any projects I do in the foreseeable. It needs to remain smooth in its appearance with a carefully thought out colour scheme.
