          <p>
            Having been able to obtain a Microsoft qualification in
            HTML5 and CSS3, I've come to really enjoy the creative aspects in
            designing a website or project.
            Currently, my passion is more Front End Development based. However,
            I am open to exploring other areas within the field of development.

        <div class="info__right-blue">
          <h3>What am I looking for?</h3>
        </div>

        <div class="info__left">
          <p>
            I am looking for any kind of work experience I can obtain. Ideally I
            am looking for full time work but would also be happy to fullfil a
            part-time or temporary role in the hopes that it will lead to a more
            permanent position.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="info__right-blue">
          <h3>Why should you hire me?</h3>

        <div class="info__left">
          <ul>
            <li>
              I have a very consistent, extremely high work ethic and always
              strive to improve.
            </li>
            <li>
              Having usually worked in teams before, I excel in these work
              environments but can also be very independent.
            </li>
            <li>
              I do enjoy meeting people in and around the workplace, and work
              hard to be as helpful and easy to work with as possible.
            </li>
            <li>
              I am confident in HTML5 and CSS3, but am currently focused on
              creating JavaScript led projects to improve that area of my Front
              End knowledge. This is due to me mainly focusing on the first two
              languages when I started learning.
            </li>
            <li>
              I am proficient in utilising Git and Github in my work. I have not
              yet contributed to many group projects but I do have knowledge of
              branching and pull requests.
            </li>
            <li>
              Over time, my projects section will show more complex projects. As
              of the moment, they are fairly simplistic which reflects my
              ability in the language of JavaScript, which I am working hard to
              develop.
