            Welcome to my Portfolio Website. <br />
            Here you will get to know me and my experience within Website
            Development. I have been learning to code on and off for over a year
            now, having come to really enjoy the creative aspects in designing a
            website or project. Therefore, my passion seems to lie more in Front
            End Development at the minute. This is where I was able to obtain a
            qualification in HTML5 and CSS3 through Microsoft.
            <br />
            This website was made entirely by myself, so that I can show off my
            skills to date.

          <h3>What am I looking for?</h3>
        </div>

        <div class="p2-background">
          <p>
            Currently, due to my lack of work experience within the field, I am
            looking for any kind of experience I can obtain. Ideally I am
            looking for full time work but would also be happy to do anything
            part-time around my current job in the hopes that it will lead to a
            greater position.
            <br />
            Although I currently favour Front End Development, I am also open to
            trying my hand in different areas of the industry.

        <div class="p2-background">
          <ul>
            <li>
              I have a very consistent, very high work ethic and always strive
              to improve.
            </li>
            <li>
              Having usually worked in teams before, I generally excel in these
              work environments but can also be very independent.
            </li>
            <li>
              I do enjoy meeting people in and around the workplace, and work
              hard to be as helpful and easy to work with as possible.
            </li>
            <li>
              I am confident in HTML5 and CSS3, but currently am mainly focused
              on creating JavaScript lead projects to improve that area of my
              Front End. This is due to me mainly focusing on the first to
              languages when I started learning.
            </li>
            <li>
              I am proficient in utilising Git and Github in my work, which I
              understand is industry standard. I have not yet contributed to
              many group projects but I do have knowledge of branching and
              pull requests.
            </li>
            <li>
              Currently, my aim is to get really confident with JavaScript so that a lot
              of the skills developed through that language can be transferrable
              across other ones, such as PHP. Overtime, my projects section will
              show more complex projects, but as of the moment, they are fairly
              basic which reflects my ability in the language.
            </li>

            If you are looking to contact me at all with any queries, you will
            find my contact details at the bottom of each page. Do not hesitate
            to get in touch as I will look to return any emails or calls as
            swiftly as possible.
