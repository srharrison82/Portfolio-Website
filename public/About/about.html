          <p>
            To give you an idea of who I am as a person, I'd like to highlight a
            few things on this page. First of all, I'm quite a social person and
            I regularly am looking to meet friends in and around work. I have
            always relished the importance of making new friends which helps
            when working in a larger team or company. I would say I am a very
            easy person to get to know, and also to liaise with.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am consistently honest with myself, as well as others too, which
            helps me to improve in different areas. Something I very much live
            by is to treat people how you want to be treated, and you can see
            this in how I carry myself day to day. I certainly wish to treat
            people fairly and create positive, beneficial relationships
            where-ever possible.
          </p>

          <p>
            My main passions include playing video games online with friends,
            being out in nature and playing sports. I was raised on many a
            camping holiday and always enjoy going for walks, runs and just
            generally exploring new places in the UK. I've been lucky enough to
            do a summer camp in Quebec, Canada as a councilor. This was post
            university which embodied a lot of the things I enjoy, like being
            out and being proactive. The main sports I follow are football,
            volleyball and badminton currently. However, I mainly only play
            badminton regularly - the social side of it all is a big part of it
            for me, as well as keeping healthy and looking after myself.
          </p>

          <h3>Why am I a good person to work with?</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>
              My favorite work environments are ones where there is always
              something to do, I like being proactive and contributing as much
              as possible. This is not only to benefit my employer, but also my
              fellow employees.
            </li>
            <li>
              Previous employers would credit my work ethic and also, my ability
              to slot in where needed learning along the way.
            </li>
            <li>
              My approachability enables me to get to know colleagues quickly,
              to help build trust within our working relationship.
            </li>
            <li>
              Something that I really value above many other things is remaining
              as easy to work with as possible, by being well spoken, polite and
              open minded.
