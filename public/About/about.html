          <p>
            I would describe myself as social and personable around people. I
            feel like this makes me a good addition to a team, as I enjoy
            creating relationships in and around work.
          </p>

          <p>
            Honesty is something I value a lot, and I strive to be honest with
            myself and others. This is a trait that has helped me to develop a lot as
            a person and create strong, stable relationships with colleagues.
          </p>

          <h3>Why am I a good person to work with?</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>
              My favorite work environments are ones where there is always
              jobs to do as I enjoy being proactive and contributing as much
              as possible. This is not only to benefit my employer, but also my
              fellow employees and personal development.
            </li>
            <li>
              Previous employers would credit my work ethic and also, my ability
              to slot in where-ever needed, as I try to be flexible as I am eager to learn.
            </li>
            <li>
              My approachability enables me to get to know colleagues quickly,
              to help build trust within our working relationship.
            </li>
            <li>
              Other traits that I really value above other things are being well spoken, polite and
              open minded to new ideas or concepts.
