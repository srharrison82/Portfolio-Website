            Hi there. Welcome to my Portfolio Website. Here you will get to know
            me and my experience within Website Development. I have been doing
            work in this field on and off for over a year now. By putting aside
            some time each week to improve my skills within the field, I have
            come to really enjoy the creative aspects to the designing a
            website. Hence, my passion seems to lie in Front End Development at
            the minute. This is where I was able to obtain a qualification in
            HTML5 and CSS3 through Microsoft.
          </p>

            I have used this website, made by myself, to introduce not only me
            but also the projects I am proud to show off. I'm looking to find a
            position, full-time with a company that is going to be able to help
            support me in this career. As a relatively new developer, I want to
            improve as quickly as possible and be as good as I can be to help
            benefit the company that would take me on. I have a very consistent
            work ethic and always strive to improve, to help make up for my lack
            of industry experience. Having usually worked in teams before, I
            generally excel in these work environments but can also be very
            independent. I do enjoy meeting people in and around the workplace.
