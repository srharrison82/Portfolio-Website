          In this first project of mine, I wanted to keep it simplistic. It will
          demonstrate my ability to use and apply basic JavaScript.<br /><br />

          The mock website will host a dynamic background which will change
          color upon the click of a button. The JavaScript will run when
          instructed to apply different CSS stylings on the page.<br /><br />

          This is my first real project using JS and there will be much more to
          come, with increasing levels of difficulty as I practice coding in
          that language. On my learning journey, I will also look to involve JS
          in this main hosting website as well, for use with various buttons and
          other dynamic utilities.
