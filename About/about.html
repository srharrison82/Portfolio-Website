          <p>
            To give you an idea of who I am as a person, I'd like to highlight a
            few things on this page. First of all, I'm quite a social person and
            I regularly am looking to meet friends in and around work. I have
            always relished the importance of making new friends which helps
            when working in a larger team or company. I would say I am a very
            easy person to get to know, and also to liaise with.
          </p>

          <p>
            By being honest with myself, I am a very self aware as a person. I
            always strive to be as good to others as I can be, whether that be
            within a professional setting or how I handle myself when I am out
            and about. Something I very much live by is to treat people how you
            want to be treated, and you can see this in how I carry myself day
            to day.
          </p>

          <p>
            My main passions include playing video games online with friends,
            being out in nature and playing sports. I was raised on many a
            camping holiday and always enjoy going for walks, runs and just
            generally exploring new places in the UK. I've been lucky enough to
            do a summer camp in Quebec, Canada as a councilor. This was post
            university which embodied a lot of the things I enjoy, like being
            out and being proactive. The main sports I follow are football,
            volleyball and badminton currently, but I mainly only play badminton
            regularly - the social side of it all is a big part of it for me, as
            well as keeping healthy and looking after myself.
          </p>

          <h3>Why would I be a good addition to your team?</h3>

          <p>
            I have a huge desire to improve on all bases and enjoy keeping busy.
            My favorite work environments are ones where there is always
            something to do, I like being proactive and contributing as much as
            possible. This is not only to benefit my employer, but also my
            fellow employees. Although I may not have much previous working
            experience within the field, I can make up for that with my desire
            to be great colleague to others, and hopefully overtime I can build
            on what I know to be a fully fledged Website Developer, with my
            passion residing within the front end for now. Previous employers
            would credit my work ethic and also, my ability to slot in where
            needed learning along the way. My approachability enables me to get
            to know colleagues quickly, to help build trust within our working
            relationship.
